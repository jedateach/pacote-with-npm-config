# Pacote with NPM Config

Wraps [pacote](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pacote) to provide npm config from the various sources.

Uses [@npmcli/config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@npmcli/config) to get the config.

## Caveat: not an exact replacement

Does not wrap the [Advanced API](https://github.com/npm/pacote?tab=readme-ov-file#advanced-api)
